<These API tests written against 'httpbin.org'>

<I used Visual Studio Code IDE, code editor>

<WebdriverIO - framework>

<Mocha JS testing framework>

<Chai JS assertion library>

<Axios JavaScript library for HTTP requests> 

<Used 'Expect' interface assertion style, since i am mostly familiar with and it works on node.js and in all browsers.> 

<'Should' can be used in this case as well, since its similar to 'Expect', but i am not very familiar with its structure>

<Familiar with 'Assert' style as well, and i like its features like allowing you to include an optional message.>
